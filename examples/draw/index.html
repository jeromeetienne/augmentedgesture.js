<!-- ## Drawing with Augmented Gesture -->

<!-- This is annoted source of the ```draw``` example for [AugmentedGesture.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/augmentedgesture.js). -->
<!-- The code is [here](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/augmentedgesture.js/tree/master/examples/draw) on github. -->
<!-- The live demo can be found [here](http://jeromeetienne.github.com/augmentedgesture.js/examples/draw). -->
<!-- It is a basic drawing program using augmented gesture to control the pencil. -->

<!-- ### Motivation -->

<!-- [Augmented Gesture](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/augmentedgesture.js) is a nice interface. I think it has potential. -->
<!-- It got a nice warm feeling because you interact with your computer in a very physical way. -->
<!-- Usually you move a mouse, so you move your harm of 20cm. -->
<!-- If you are a developer, you type a lot on keyboards, so you move your fingers of a few centimeters. -->
<!-- The physical effort is very limited. The relationship between me and my computer is mostly intellectual. -->
<!-- [Augmented Gesture](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/augmentedgesture.js) make it a lot more physical. -->
<!-- I even joked about it in this video "[Doom: a new workout for geek?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUYM93xaIgg)". -->

<!-- But maybe there is more to it. -->
<!-- Being more physical and less intellectual, it may means more instinctive, less to learn... The user feels confortable faster. -->
<!-- So the user can focus on creativity and forget the tool. -->
<!-- Children are good at that. -->

<!-- All that to say, i like this new way to interact with computer, so im experimenting with it in various contextes. -->
<!-- Here it is basic drawing. -->

<!-- Clearly the drawing is very basic, so creavity may be limited by that :) -->
<!-- Maybe it would be fun to link it with [harmony](http://mrdoob.com/projects/harmony/) by [mrdoob](http://mrdoob.com/). -->

<!-- # Let's get started -->

<!-- First we define a minimal html5 page. -->
<!-- Then we include the code of [augmentedgesture.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/augmentedgesture.js). -->
<!-- The '-bundle' file is augmentedgesture.js itself plus its dependancies bundled in a single file for convenience. -->
<!doctype html><title>Augmented Reality Draw</title>
<script src="../../build/augmentedgesture-bundle.js"></script>
<body>
<!-- ## Create Canvas -->

<!-- Now we gonna define the canvas 'drawing'. This is where we gonna draw. -->
<!-- We add a pinch of css to put it on top/left. -->
<canvas id="drawing" style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0;"></canvas>	
<script>
	// ## Initialize Canvas Element

	// First step is to get the [DOM Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element)
	// from the [document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/document). We just [fetch
	// it with its ID](https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Document.getElementById) 'drawing'.
	var canvas	= document.getElementById('drawing')
	// We set the resolution of the canvas. It will use the whole window,
	// so we use ```window.innerWidth``` and ```.innerHeight```.
	// TODO put a speech on the resolution/screensize difference on canvas
	// "did you knew that ..." ?
	canvas.width	= window.innerWidth;
	canvas.height	= window.innerHeight;
	var ctx		= canvas.getContext('2d');

	// clear the screen
	ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(0,0,0)";
	ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

	// AUGMENTED GESTURE
	
	// init augmentedgesture.js
	var aGesture	= new AugmentedGesture().enableDatGui().start()
				.domElementThumbnail();
	// create a pointer
	var pointerId	= "Green ball";
	var pointerOpts	= new AugmentedGesture.OptionPointer();
	aGesture.addPointer(pointerId, pointerOpts);
	// setup marker color
	pointerOpts.colorFilter.r	= {min:   0, max:  60};
	pointerOpts.colorFilter.g	= {min:   0, max: 255};
	pointerOpts.colorFilter.b	= {min:  45, max: 255};
	
	// AUGMENTEDGESTURE + CANVAS
	// bind augmented gesture "mousemove" event for this pointerId
	aGesture.bind("mousemove."+pointerId, function(event){
		// convert event coord [0,1( into canvas coord
		var x	= event.x * window.innerWidth;
		var y	= event.y * window.innerHeight;
		// clear the screen - use global alpha for fade out
		// TODO explain this 
		ctx.globalAlpha = 0.025;
		ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(0,0,0)";
		ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
		// setup circle fill style
		ctx.globalAlpha = 1;
		ctx.fillStyle = "rgb(200,0,0)";

		// Now the drawing itself. We gonna draw the circle using the
		// [canvas path api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Drawing_Graphics_with_Canvas).
		// the center of the circle is ```x, y``` with a radius of ```30```.
		// A bit long, this api is quite verbose. Why not ```ctw.fillCircle(x,y, radius)``` you probably ask yourself.
		// Well i dunno either. If you find out, please tell me :)
		ctx.beginPath();
		ctx.arc(x, y, 30, 0, Math.PI*2, true); 
		ctx.closePath();
		ctx.fill();
	})
	// Now we just end the page and we are done! :)
